# Project Title: Manipulating Data using Apache Spark

This project is focused on using Apache Spark, a big data processing framework, to manipulate and analyze data. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project, `flights.csv`, contains a row for every flight that departed from Portland International Airport (PDX) or Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) in 2014 and 2015.

## Objectives

The main aim of this project is to manipulate and analyze flight data using Apache Spark DataFrame API and SQL commands. Here are the steps followed:

1. Create a DataFrame using the `flights.csv` file and then create a table (temporary view) for querying flights using SQL commands.

2. Use SQL to retrieve the first five rows of the flights table.

3. Write a SQL query that counts the number of flights to each airport from SEA and PDX.

## Results

The detailed results and insights from the data manipulation and analysis are presented in the Jupyter notebook. Please refer to the notebook for a comprehensive understanding of the project outcomes.
